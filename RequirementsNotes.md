Note requirements here.

Emailed the 343 class on 21/3/2013 for input on requirements. 

Requirements:
- Needs to be able to compile and download onto the lego robots
- Support for all the old formats used by the current NXTCC program
- Support for the current functionality in NXTCC (diagnostic tools, direct control, brick joystick, etc)


Improvements which need to be made based on NXTCC:
- Better support for indentation
- Syntax highlighting
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Ability to have multiple windows or tabs
- Improved support when opening existing files (the default save format is .nxc, the default open format is .nbc(?))
- Text completion could be considered
