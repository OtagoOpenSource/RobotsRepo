RobotsRepo
==========

The initial repo for the Robots team.

The robots team is going to work on a cross-platform IDE/compiler for lego robots. I think what we want to create is something a bit like RobotC (which works well on Windows but not on anything else). However, neither the language nor the environment need be the same, but that is the sort of thing we're chasing. Relatively easy to use and hopefully reliable.

==========
To do:

Initially there are two related tasks. The first is to investigate what open-source tools are already available and see if they can be co-opted into the project and developed further. For example, we might try and make use of the nxc compiler.

The second task is to do some requirements gathering. There are a few potential sources of information here. Sandy Garner has a need for a friendly development environment to support the kids in her schoolchildren robotics clubs. Also the 3rd year AI students and staff make use of a particular environment for programming the robots in one of the assignments (I believe they aren't particularly enthused about the environment they have).

Once we have those two bits of information, we can decide what the next steps should be.
